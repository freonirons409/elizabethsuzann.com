<h3 id="question-one">1. I placed an order but never received an order confirmation.</h3>
<p>Customers should receive an order confirmation upon placing their order. If you have not received an email confirmation, first check your junk/spam folder. If the confirmation email is still missing, it is possible your email was entered incorrectly at checkout — email us at <a href="mailto:support@elizabethsuzann.com">support@elizabethsuzann.com</a> so we can locate your confirmation and forward it to the correct address.</p>
<h3 id="question-two">2. I placed an order and haven’t received my shipping confirmation yet — where is my order?</h3>
<p>All of our garments are made to order right here in our <a href="http://elizabethsuzann.com/pages/studio">Nashville design studio and production facility</a>. Unless otherwise noted, each order takes our team approximately 2-3 weeks to cut, sew, pack, and ship. Please note that given the nature of made to order production, lead time may vary depending on current order volume, which makes it very difficult for us to guarantee delivery dates.</p>
<p>If your order is older than the usual 2-3 weeks, we apologize for the delay, and thank you for your patience! We promise we're working hard to finish your garment and get it on your doorstep as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Please note that we do not automatically provide customers with periodic updates on the status of their orders, unless there is an unusual delay. When your order ships, you will receive an email confirmation with shipping and tracking details.</p>
<h3 id="question-three">3. I am petite, how will the one size garments fit on me?</h3>
<p>Often these items are intended to have a loose, relaxed fit. While individual bodies and personal preferences vary, customers with smaller figures are typically comfortable and satisfied with the fit. If you are unsure about the sizing of a specific garment, our support team would be happy to help, so please <a href="http://elizabethsuzann.com/pages/contact">send us an email</a> before ordering!</p>
<h3 id="question-four">4. Can you customize a garment for me?</h3>
<p>Due to time constraints and volume, we do not offer customizations at this time. We love to hear our customers' input, however altering design elements or producing garments in different colors/fabrications is not always possible. All of our garments are easily alterable at your local tailor should you need changes in hem length, etc. We apologize for any inconvenience!</p>
<h3 id="question-five">5. Can you rush ship my order?</h3>
<p>No, we do not currently offer expedited shipping. Orders within the US ship via USPS Priority Mail and typically arrive in 2-3 business days after production is complete. If you would like to receive your order by a certain date, please plan on allowing at least 2-3 weeks for production, taking account for delivery time. See our <a href="http://elizabethsuzann.com/pages/shipping-returns">Shipping &amp; Returns</a> policy for more information.</p>
<h3 id="question-six">6. Do you offer gift wrapping?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! Every order comes neatly wrapped and ready for giving, but feel free to let us know if you are ordering something as a gift. We can ship the package to the recipient’s address and include a customized message at your request.</p>
<h3 id="question-seven">7. Can I return or exchange an item I purchased?</h3>
<p>Of course! If for any reason an item does not work out for you, we gladly offer free returns for store credit within 14 days of receiving your package. Store credit never expires and is issued in the form of a digital gift card. We do NOT offer cash refunds at this time. Visit our <a href="http://elizabethsuzann.com/pages/shipping-returns">Shipping &amp; Returns</a><span> page for more information.</span></p>
<h3 id="question-eight">8. Can I change/cancel/add to my order after it is placed?</h3>
<p>Since each garment is made to order, we are unable to accept cancellations for refunds.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we can add to/combine multiple orders to save on shipping costs. To combine multiple orders, email us at <a href="mailto:support@elizabethsuzann.com">support@elizabethsuzann.com</a> as soon as possible after placing your order. </p>
<p><span>If you’d like to make a change to your order (e.g., different size or color), we’d be happy to help you as long as your order hasn’t shipped. Just keep in mind that it can take an additional 2-3 weeks to complete your updated order.</span></p>
<p>If you need to make a change to your shipping address, email us at <a href="mailto:support@elizabethsuzann.com">support@elizabethsuzann.com</a>. We can change the address as long as the package has not left our facility. Unfortunately, we cannot reroute a package once it has shipped.</p>
<p>Please see our <a href="http://elizabethsuzann.com/pages/shipping-returns">Shipping &amp; Returns</a> policy for more information.</p>
<h3 id="question-nine">9. Do you offer a sale price adjustment?</h3>
<p>Yes, we offer a sale price adjustment on items purchased within 7 days of a sale. To claim a price adjustment, notify us at <a href="mailto:support@elizabethsuzann.com">support@elizabethsuzann.com</a> within 7 days of the sale date. Price adjustments are issued in the form of a digital gift card for store credit.</p>
<h3 id="question-ten">10. I am interested in an item that is out of stock.</h3>
<p>We aim to keep all of our garments available for order, but if we run out of a certain fabric or discontinue a pattern, an item may go out of stock. For more information, email <a href="mailto:support@elizabethsuzann.com">support@elizabethsuzann.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="question-eleven">11. I would love to collaborate/interview/work with you, how can I get in touch?</h3>
<p>We would love to hear from you! Email <a href="mailto:press@elizabethsuzann.com">press@elizabethsuzann.com</a> with inquiries.</p>
<h3 id="question-twelve">12. Can I come visit or shop in person at the studio in Nashville?</h3>
<p>Yes, absolutely! Our showroom is located directly inside <a href="http://elizabethsuzann.com/pages/studio">our production facility and design studio</a>, so not only can you shop in person, you'll also get to see the process behind the products.

<h3 id="question-thirteen">13. Can I carry your clothing in my retail shop?</h3>
